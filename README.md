# Multi-Agent AI Classification System

This repository contains a **portfolio version** of a hands-on multi-agent AI project
focused on agentic AI and generative AI–based classification.

## Overview
The project demonstrates how multiple AI agents can be orchestrated using
generative AI models to perform classification tasks.
Instead of rule-based logic, the system relies on prompt-based intelligence
and agent-based architecture.

## Key Concepts
- Agentic AI systems
- Multi-agent architecture
- Prompt-based classification
- Generative AI (LLMs)
- Python-based AI system design

## Project Structure
- This repository presents a **cleaned and documented portfolio version**
  of the project for professional sharing.
- The **original experimentation and learning notebook** was developed on Kaggle.

## Original Kaggle Notebook
You can view the original Kaggle notebook (raw learning and experimentation version) here:

## Note
This project was created for learning and experimentation purposes as part of
hands-on practice with agent-based AI systems and generative models.
